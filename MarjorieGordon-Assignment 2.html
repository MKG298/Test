        <h2>Are Consumers Really Paying More for Household Groceries?</h2>
        <p>HThe Consumer Price Index (CPI), collected and published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), measures price levels for a basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI is the most publicized and widely used measure of consumer price inflation in the U.S. economy. The CPI for food is the component of the all-items CPI measuring changes in U.S. retail food prices. Industry analysts, food market participants, and policymakers closely follow the CPI for food.</p>
